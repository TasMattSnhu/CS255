The DriverPass project involved designing a system for a client that provides driving exam preparation services. The goal was to create a system that offers students both online practice exams and on-the-road training to help them prepare for their driving tests. Throughout the project, I worked on creating a comprehensive Business Requirements Document (BRD) to ensure the system design met the client's needs. I feel I did particularly well in crafting the BRD, as it clearly outlined both functional and non-functional requirements. By establishing a solid foundation, the BRD will allow a team and stakeholders align on the project’s goals, ensuring that the development process stayed on track.

If I could revise one part of my work, it would be the diagrams I created. I'm generally not very strong in creating visual representations, and I believe the diagrams could have been more user-friendly and easier to interpret. Improving their clarity and visual appeal would make them more digestible for both technical and non-technical stakeholders. In terms of user needs, I made sure that every requirement and design element was directly backed by the DriverPass interview transcript. It was important that nothing in the BRD or design doc was based on my assumptions; everything needed to reflect the client’s needs. My approach to designing software always centers around the customer’s vision, and I often draw inspiration from well-designed applications I encounter in my day-to-day life. In the future, I plan to continue using this customer-focused approach while also refining my skills in diagram creation to better communicate technical designs.
